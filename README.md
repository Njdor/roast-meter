        An awesome DIY projects that will help you get better consistent roasts by measuring roast color between batches
        <br />
        The njdor fork provides CAD models and code to run this on budget aliexpress OLED screens and ESP32-s3 (or any mcu really).

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Starting into home roasting I've quickly realised the importance of a roast meter to evaluate the color of the coffee, this helps you better target different end temperature/time but retain the same level of color and see how it influences taste.


Here's why:
* Commercial grade roast meters are very expensive
* Chips and sensors are are readily available/cheap and easy to get going
* At the end of the guide you will have an ~100$ roast meter, that is consistent and can help you get the most out of your roast.

Check out our wiki for detailed instructions for assembly usage and calibration!

## njdor's Version BOM - Follow Juztin's BOM but swap below parts
1x 0.96 Inch OLED Display Module SSD1306 I2C IIC SPI Serial 128X64 - get the one with slotted connections\
1x ESP32-S3 - Either SEEED Studio XIAO S3 or the SuperMini from Aliexpress\
8x M3-8mm (for printable shield and screwing case together, Juztin's docs are out of date with his design). Use M3-4mm if not using shield\
4x M1.6-6mm (for ali oled, if using)\

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
* ~~Calibration against Agtron Gourmet Scale~~ (DONE)
* ~~Add battery, on/off button~~ (DONE)
* ~~Sensor calibration process - improved for consistency~~ (DONE)
* ~~Mobile application to store coffee roast information as well as roast level and history (bluetooth)~~ (BT version available but works with **external** web app)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/juztins-lab/roast-meter/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
